# Overview

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

> 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

> 'features.txt': List of all features.

> 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

> 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

> 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

> 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

> 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

> 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

> 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

> 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

> 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 

> Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

> Each feature vector is a row on the text file.



Description of the DATA

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) – both using a low pass Butterworth filter.

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the ‘f’ to indicate frequency domain signals).

Description of abbreviations of measurements

leading t or f is based on time or frequency measurements.

Body = related to body movement.

Gravity = acceleration of gravity

Acc = accelerometer measurement

Gyro = gyroscopic measurements

Jerk = sudden movement acceleration

Mag = magnitude of movement

mean and SD are calculated for each subject for each activity for each mean and SD measurements.

The units given are g’s for the accelerometer and rad/sec for the gyro and g/sec and rad/sec/sec for the corresponding jerks.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:

‘-XYZ’ is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They total 33 measurements including the 3 dimensions - the X,Y, and Z axes.

tBodyAcc-XYZ

tGravityAcc-XYZ

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ

tBodyGyro-XYZ

tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ

tBodyAccMag

tGravityAccMag

tBodyAccJerkMag

tBodyGyroMag

tBodyGyroJerkMag

fBodyAcc-XYZ

fBodyAccJerk-XYZ

fBodyGyro-XYZ

fBodyAccMag

fBodyAccJerkMag

fBodyGyroMag

fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation
